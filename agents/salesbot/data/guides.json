{"vacuum-cleaners": "Removing cobwebs, sucking up dust bunnies, and cleaning the pet hair off of your carpets and furniture is easy when you have a powerful vacuum cleaner.\nWhether you\u2019re vacuuming the living room of an apartment or a large house with multiple floors, having a new vacuum cleaner means you can keep your home sparkling clean.\nTable of contents\nWhat to consider when buying a vacuum cleaner\nThere are quite a few different factors to consider when buying a vacuum cleaner.

Dander is a microscopic allergen, and if you want to reduce it or make sure you aren\u2019t re-filtering allergens into the air when you\u2019re cleaning, you\u2019ll need a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to capture every spec.\nCertain models of upright vacuum cleaner will capture up to 99% of allergens, leaving the air you breath after vacuuming cleaner than it was before.\nDo you need a lightweight vacuum for quick cleaning or for stairs?\nIf you have stairs in your home and you know you\u2019ll be moving your vacuum cleaner up and down, weight may factor into your vacuum cleaner choice. A stick vacuum takes on stairs quickly and easily, while an upright vacuum has attachments and a long hose so you can leave the body of the vacuum at the bottom and work your way up.

They mount on a docking station on your wall so you can store your vacuum and charge it at the same time. Because they aren\u2019t plugged into a power source and work on rechargeable batteries, they maintain full power for around half-hour to an hour before they need to be charged again.\nYou can also choose to purchase an additional battery so you can change them out and keep cleaning for longer. Stick vacuums like the Dyson V11 Outsize include an additional battery and charger so you can clean for up to 120 minutes.\nBrush head size\nStick vacuums have full-sized brush heads that cover a wide area while vacuuming, and you can find stick vacuums with soft roller brush heads to clean hard floors, extra-large brush heads, and mini-motorized brush heads to clean the interior of your vehicle.\nYou\u2019ll also find stick vacuums like the Tineco Pure One S12 Pro EX with an LED on the brush head that lights up the floor in front of you when you\u2019re cleaning.\nUpright Vacuums\nWhen you want a vacuum cleaner that will easily take on your entire home, an When you want a vacuum cleaner that will easily take on your entire home, an upright vacuum is a great choice.

The body and long hose are bulkier than an upright or stick vacuum, so they need a bit more space in the closet.\nRobotic Vacuums\nA robotic vacuum cleaner offers up the ultimate hands-free cleaning experience. These compact, independent vacuum cleaners glide over all types of floors, have built-in sensors to map out your home, and are designed to avoid hazards like stairs.\nA robotic vacuum will easily cruise under your furniture, and when some models are finished cleaning or nearing the end of their battery life, they will automatically head back to their docking station for a recharge.\nCertain models of robot vacuum will work on a schedule every day, while others also connect to your home\u2019s Wi-Fi network so you can login to an app, tap the clean button, and send your robot vacuum off to clean your floors.\nRobot vacuums map your home\nRobot vacuums can navigate your home\u2019s obstacles and cover every area thanks to a built-in mapping feature.\nRobot vacuums originally used bounce mapping to navigate around obstacles in your home, bouncing off objects until they find a clear path. The latest robot vacuums still use shock-absorbing bumpers to steer around objects, but many of the newest models use that technology in combination with advanced self-navigation.\nDepending on which brand of robot vacuum you choose, the self-navigation system in your robot vacuum may use onboard digital cameras, lasers, or 3D imaging. The robot takes the data it collects and compiles it into a map, and the more you use the robot vacuum the more accurate your home\u2019s map will be.\nAuto Evac Robots empty your dust bin for you\nThe latest robot vacuums have large dust bins so they can collect more dirt before you need to empty the bin.

While more powerful, they tend to be bulkier than a handheld carpet cleaner.\nHard Floor Cleaners and Steamers\nHardwood floor is a popular option in many homes, and because more and more people are switching out their carpets for hardwood, hard floor cleaners and steamers are a must-have. They look like a mop, but once filled with water and connected to power, the water heats up and steam is pushed out of the bottom of the cleaner.\nWhen the steam hits the floor it can loosen and remove stubborn stains, kill bacteria, and sanitize without having to use cleaning products.

Having a coffee maker on your kitchen counter means you can brew pot after pot of coffee without ever leaving home. With unique features and precise brewing, the latest brewers put the best cup of coffee in your hands every time you turn them on.\nTable of contents\n1. Types of coffee makers\n2. Features to look for in coffee makers\n3. What to consider before buying a coffee maker\n4. Coffee accessories\nBenefits of having a coffee maker at home\nYou know what it\u2019s like to walk into a coffee shop and take a deep breath, inhaling that fragrant coffee aroma? You can experience that every morning in your kitchen and all you need is a drip or single-serve brewer on your kitchen counter, or even a French press or percolator.\nHaving a coffee maker in your kitchen saves time and money. You don\u2019t have to leave home to go to a coffee drive-thru or stand in line at a shop. If you like variety in your coffee cup, you\u2019ll love that you can enjoy any number of coffee flavours, pods, and variations depending on what type of bean or grind you\u2019ve brought home.\nTypes of coffee makers\nThe days of anxiously watching your brewer chug its way to a full pot are long gone. Now you can put your morning cup of coffee in your hand right when you want it, and there are a lot of options for serving up the freshest, most flavourful cup of brew.\nEspresso machines\nAn espresso machine is a brewer that makes customized coffee beverages. With an espresso machine you can make lattes, cappuccinos, Americanos, and more. Some types of espresso maker also make iced coffee drinks. There are four main types of espresso machines.\nManual espresso machines\nManual espresso machines give you complete control over your shot of espresso. This type of machine has a lever you pull when you\u2019re ready to make espresso, and that gives you control over how long the water pushes through your coffee grinds and how large of an espresso shot you create.\nSemi automatic espresso machines\nA semi automatic espresso machine is a popular option for anyone who wants to create custom coffee beverages at home. It\u2019s easier to use than a manual espresso machine as it has an electric pump that creates the shot, but you can still control everything from the water flow to the pressure your coffee grinds are extracted.\nFully automatic espresso machine\nA fully automatic espresso maker automates the process of creating an espresso shot. It takes care of everything involved in creating a shot of espresso including water pressure and tamping. Many types of fully automatic espresso machines have a milk frother to make milk foam or steamed milk.\nSuper automatic espresso machine\nA super automatic espresso maker will grind, tamp, and brew your espresso shot with just a tap. They have built-in burr grinders, milk frothers, and programmable settings so you can choose which coffee drink you\u2019d like and your machine will make it for you.\nYou can learn more about espresso machines in the espresso machine buying guide.\nDrip coffee maker\nDrip coffee makers are one of the most popular types found in kitchens everywhere. With this style, you\u2019ll use a disposable or reusable coffee filter, add a set amount of coffee grinds, and turn the coffee maker on. The appliance heats up the water to a certain temperature and pours that hot water over your coffee grinds, dripping it into the carafe below.\nDrip coffee makers come with glass or insulated carafes that hold anywhere from one to 12 cups of coffee, and they usually take less than 10 minutes to brew a full pot. One of the biggest benefits of a drip brewer is that you can brew multiple cups worth of coffee and go back to the pot, enjoying it without the further delay of brewing again.\nDrip coffee makers are great if you and one or more people will be enjoying coffee every day. If you only plan on making enough coffee for one, you may want to choose a single-serve coffee maker.\nSingle-serve coffee maker\nA single-serve coffee maker will make exactly that; a single serving of coffee. You can find single-serve brewers that work with single-serve coffee pods, reusable coffee pods, or coffee grinds.\nTo use a single-serve appliance, add water to the reservoir, add a pod to the coffee maker, and hit a button to serve. Depending on the speed of the model you choose, you can have a 4 to 12-ounce cup of coffee in your hands in under a minute.\nSingle-serve coffee makers are extremely popular, and one of the reasons why is because there is no guesswork on the proper measurement for adding coffee grinds or water. Because the machine is automated, you let it do all the work, and you\u2019re guaranteed the perfect cup of coffee in no time at all.\nA single serve coffee maker is a great option for one or two people who always want a hot cup of fresh coffee. Just keep in mind that making coffee with pods can be slightly more expensive than purchasing bulk coffee beans. Coffee pods can also produce more disposable waste than coffee grinds made with a paper or reusable filter.\nMulti-use coffee maker\nA multi-use coffee maker is designed to take on the job of a drip coffee maker, a single-serve brewer, or an espresso machine. The average multi-use coffee maker will have a drip brewer on one side that makes up to 12 cups of coffee at a time and a single-serve brewer on the other side to make individual cups. Some multi-use coffee makers can also make coffee beverages like lattes or Americanos.\nA multi-use coffee maker gives you the best of all worlds. If you only need one cup of coffee, you won\u2019t need to waste an entire pot. Depending on which multi-use brewer you choose, you may also have the option of having a built-in bean grinder.\nMulti-use brewers are the perfect choice for a couple of family who want a bit of coffee variety or the option to switch between a coffee maker that makes up to 12 cups or a single serve brewer. This style may be slightly more expensive than a drip coffee maker and a single serve brewer, but you\u2019ll have two appliances in one. It also may take up a bit more space on your counter top.\nFrench press and coffee percolator\nA French press is the simplest type of coffee maker. It doesn\u2019t use electricity and your coffee is made by hand. It has a plunger inside where you add ground-up coffee beans. Once your beans are added, pour hot water over them and let them steep in the carafe. You\u2019ll pull the plunger of grinds slowly up to the top of the press, removing it and replacing it with the lid. Making coffee with a French press requires a bit of practice, but once you master it you may never go back to drip coffee again. For many coffee fans, a French press makes the most flavourful cup.\nA coffee percolator lets you make coffee on a larger scale than some models of drip brewer, and it\u2019s a very portable option because brewing and pouring are done from a single device. Coffee percolators hold coffee grinds at the top of the device. There is a hollow tube that filters down from the grind holder to the bottom of the appliance. Hot water begins boiling and it will be forced up into the tube and onto the coffee grinds, soaking them and letting them drip back into the pot to make coffee.\nHaving a French press means you\u2019ll always have the freshest cup of coffee, but it does take slightly longer to brew than a drip or single-serve brewer. You\u2019ll need to boil water in a kettle or pot on the stove before you can make your coffee, and you\u2019ll need to leave it brew for a few minutes.\nPour over coffee maker\nA pour over coffee maker is a manual coffee maker that\u2019s similar in style to a French press. You\u2019ll use a glass carafe with a type of funnel placed over the opening. To make coffee in a pour over coffee maker you\u2019ll add a filter to the funnel, add coffee grounds, and pour boiling water over the grinds. Your coffee will filter through to the carafe and you can pour it into your cup.\nOne of the best parts of the pour over style is that you can control every part of the coffee-making process. You can use extremely hot water if you like your coffee very hot, and you can control the time it brews or how much coffee you make at one time. Just keep in mind that making coffee using a pour over carafe takes a bit more time than a drip brewer. Just like a French press, you\u2019ll need to boil water first.\nFeatures on the best coffee makers\nThe latest coffee brewers are designed to give you a lot of choices when it comes to your cup of coffee.\nChoose your brew strength and temperature\nYou can find drip and single-serve brewers that will let you choose your coffee strength and temperature. Being able to choose a strong brew when you need a wake-up is a great option for mornings, and you can dial down the strength as your day progresses. If you like your coffee very hot or you want to make coffee to pour over ice, you\u2019ll love being able to adjust your coffee temperature.\nBuilt-in coffee grinders\nCoffee fans know that the freshest cup of coffee starts with the freshest ground coffee beans. When you have a coffee grinder built into your coffee maker, your beans will go from whole to ground to coffee, all in one fluid motion.\nBrew timers\nWith a coffee maker that has a 24-hour or 12-hour time delay or scheduler, you can set your brewer to turn on before you wake up in the morning. That means your coffee will be hot and ready for you to drink before you\u2019ve even opened your eyes. You can also find models that have an automatic off switch so you don\u2019t have to worry about your pot burning if you forget about it.\nPot warmers and carafes\nIt might take you a few hours to drink an entire pot of coffee, and you don\u2019t want it to grow cold in the meantime. You can choose a brewer with a pot warmer or one that includes an insulated carafe so your coffee is hot and ready to drink long after you\u2019ve brewed it.\nLarge water reservoirs\nA single-serve brewer is available in models that hold a single cup of water or several cups. If you have a reservoir that holds several cups of water you can brew cup after cup without refilling the tank.\nPause while brewing\nIf you\u2019ve ever put a coffee mug under your coffee pot to catch any drips while you\u2019re quickly pouring yourself a cup, you\u2019ll love the pause while brewing feature. It lets you pull your coffee pot out to pour a cup and will hold the brew inside the machine until you put it back.\nSelf-cleaning brewers\nBecause they use water, coffee makers occasionally need to be descaled and have any buildup removed. The latest models will prompt you to use a descaling solution, or you can touch a self-cleaning button and your appliance will clean itself.\nWhat to consider before buying a coffee maker\nWhat type of coffee maker you choose depends on a few important considerations.\nAre you a multi-cup coffee drinker?\nHow often you drink coffee can be the key factor in what type of brewer you choose. If you know you\u2019ll drink half a pot or more every day, you may want to opt for a drip coffee maker with a 12-cup capacity. If you only have one or two cups in the morning, you might want a single-serve brewer you can just reload when you\u2019re ready.\nHow much counter space do you have?\nYou\u2019ll want to consider your kitchen\u2019s counter space before you choose your new brewer. Some types won\u2019t take up a lot of space and fit neatly in a corner or can be stored inside your cabinet, while others require more room. If you\u2019re short on space you may want to consider a French press, small single-serve brewer, or small drip style. If you have a lot of room on your counter, a drip brewer, multi-use brewer, or espresso machine will easily fit in.\nHow many times per day do you drink coffee?\nDrip models are available with insulated carafes and warming plates to keep your coffee hot for hours. If you\u2019d like to drink coffee in the afternoon but don\u2019t want to make a fresh pot, a single-serve brewer will serve up a fresh cup when you want one.\nDo you want your coffee ready before you get out of bed?\nProgrammable drip coffee makers are available with built-in timers so you can set your appliance at night, turn it on in the morning before you get out of bed, and have it turn off after a certain amount of time.\nDo you like the idea of pre-measured pods of coffee?\nWhen you have a drip model, you might find you need to tweak your brew to find the perfect combination of water and coffee grinds. With a single-serve brewer, the water and coffee grinds are already predetermined by the brewer and a coffee pod, so you get the perfect cup every time.\nCoffee accessories\nYou can enhance your coffee experience and make the most out of your brewer by adding coffee maker accessories.\nCoffee filters\nIf your drip or single-serve coffee maker requires a filter, you can find different types for different coffee makers. Single-serve coffee makers require you to replace the water filter from time to time and drip coffee makers either use reusable paper filters or have permanent coffee baskets you can replace if you need to.\nWater filters\nSome brewers have a water filter that will need to be replaced every few months. Water filters are essential as they remove substances in your water that can affect the taste of your coffee.\nCup warmer\nCup warmers come in two different types. They can keep your mugs warm until you\u2019re ready to brew your coffee, or they act as a warming plate to keep your coffee warm after it has been brewed.\nCoffee maker cleaner\nBoth drip and single-serve coffee makers need to be cleaned occasionally. You can buy descaling fluid or coffee maker cleaner to rid your coffee maker of any buildup in the lines.\nReusable coffee pod\nIf you have a single-serve brewer the sky is the limit for what type of coffee pod you can choose, but did you know you can choose a reusable coffee pod that uses your own coffee grinds?\nThe benefit of having a reusable coffee pod is that you can grind your own fresh beans for your coffee, and a reusable pod can be rinsed out for use again and again.\nCoffee pod storage\nCoffee pod storage lets you place your favourite coffee pods front and centre. You can choose drawers, coffee pod carousels, or set up a condiment bar for coffee right on your kitchen counter.\nTake the next step\nWake up every day with a smile by setting up a coffee maker on your kitchen counter. You can find the perfect coffee maker for you by shopping Best Buy.", "mattress": "Getting a good night\u2019s sleep is essential to your health and well-being, and having a good mattress that suits your body and sleep style can make a world of difference. The experts suggest that you should check your mattress every seven years to ensure that it is still providing optimal support, and helping relieve pressure on your body versus causing pain. If your mattress isn\u2019t helping you get restful sleep, it\u2019s time to replace it.\nThere are plenty of different mattress types, ranging from innerspring to gel memory foam, and they come in different sizes, levels of firmness, and with different materials. So it\u2019s important that you select one that will fit your sleep needs, and will keep you comfortable the whole night through.\nTypes of mattresses\nThere are four main types of mattresses from which you can choose, though there are others as well, such as air mattresses, crib mattresses, and even waterbeds.\nInnerspring Mattress\nInnerspring mattresses, also known as coil mattresses, are the most commonly found type of mattresses. They use a steel coil support system made with a set of pocketed metal springs or coils inside, and a comfort layer on the outside made from a variety of foam and fibre materials. Usually, the more coils an innerspring mattress has, and the better the coil design and gauge, the more comfortable it will be. The way the coils are arranged can also impact how to mattress feels when you lie down, so it\u2019s important to test each one out, as not every innerspring mattress will feel the same. (Or any mattress, for that matter.) When lying down on an innerspring mattress, you might find it pretty easy to change positions, which makes them great for those who tend to toss and turn during the night, and change their sleep positions often, or for couples who both sleep in different ways and want a mattress to accommodate both their needs. But they can offer poor motion isolation, so they might not be the greatest option if you tend to always sleep on your back, for example, or your stomach.\nMemory Foam Mattress\nIf you suffer from neck and back pain, you might want to look into getting a memory foam mattress. They mold to the shape of your body, providing good support while you sleep. While it might be a bit harder to change positions in a memory foam mattress versus an innerspring, since you essentially sink into a comfortable spot to can catch some ZZZs, sound sleepers who don\u2019t move a lot at night might prefer them. Memory foam mattresses are also good for cold sleepers, since they tend to keep you warm and toasty. Usually, they are made using materials like visco-elastic or latex foam. Once you get up from the bed, the mattress springs back to its original shape, then contours once again to your body when you lie down and get comfortable.\nGel Memory Foam Mattresses\nAs an alternative to memory foam, gel memory foam is made with gel added to the foam mattress for an extra layer of support. They also provide a different feel to traditional memory foam. Gel memory foam mattresses can be made using materials like green tea extract and all-natural active charcoal, which can help absorb moisture and eliminate odour \u2013 great for those who sweat a lot in their sleep. The material pushes back on the heaviest parts of your body to offer better support where you need it, and offers improved airflow. Unlike memory foam, which is great for cold sleepers, gel memory foam is ideal for hot sleepers who want to be kept cooler at night, since they can more effectively dissipate your body heat. Similarly to memory foam, because gel memory foam contours so nicely to your body, you might find it harder to move around on a gel memory foam mattress versus an innerspring. Gel memory foam mattresses are usually quite durable, and long-lasting.\nLatex Foam Mattress\nYou\u2019ll find latex foam mattresses, made from latex instead of memory foam, in a variety of sizes, including smaller sizes, made for things like bunk beds or rollaway beds, or intended for use while camping or enjoying other similar activities. As an alternative to an innerspring mattress, a latex mattress uses natural versus synthetic materials, including plant or petroleum-based materials, which makes them hypoallergenic. This, then, means they are a good the mattress of choice for those who have severe allergies to different synthetic materials. They offer relatively good support, but you\u2019ll have to check the firmness and plushness to see how it fits the way you sleep.\nDifferent types of mattress firmness\nIt isn\u2019t necessarily the type of mattress alone that determines the mattress\u2019 firmness, nor is it the type of support. Mattress support, in fact, is different than its level of firmness.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the perfect level of firmness of a mattress will really depend on an individual person\u2019s opinion and desires, so it\u2019s advisable to try out a mattress before deciding if it is right for you. That said, knowing more about the general levels of firmness can be a good starting guide to knowing what will best suit you.\nSoft Mattress\nA soft mattress is a good option for side sleepers, since it contours to your body, and can relieve some pressure when you\u2019re positioned this way. It\u2019s also good for light sleepers. But a soft firmness mattress probably won\u2019t provide sufficient support for those who really need to keep their necks and backs supported while they sleep. If you sleep on your stomach or back, you\u2019ll need a firmer mattress.\nFirm Mattress\nIf you most often sleep on your stomach, or tend to sleep quite heavily, a firm mattress is a good choice, since it helps to relieve pressure on your lower back. You might find these mattresses feel very hard when you lie on them, and they might be better suited to men, or those who are heavier since they offer a bit of extra support. Some people simply prefer extra-firm mattresses, so it\u2019s all about personal preference, as long as you wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free in the morning.\nMedium-Firm Mattress\nThe most popular type, not surprisingly, lies somewhere in the middle with a medium-firm mattress that will work equally well for those who sleep on their backs, and those who sleep on their stomachs. These mattresses are not too soft such that you\u2019ll sink in a few inches every time you lie down, but they aren\u2019t extremely firm, and feel like they offer good support, but less give, so to speak.\nMattress size options\nOf course the size of mattress you choose will be directly determined by the size of the bedframe you have, or plan to buy. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the main size options.\nKing-sized mattress\nA king-sized mattress, which fits a king-sized bed, usually measures about 76\u201d x 80\u201d in size, and is perfect in rooms large enough to accommodate them, such as a master bedroom. There\u2019s enough space for two people to comfortably sleep, and stretch out; or even to fit a baby or child in between if needed without feeling cramped. If one person tends to move around a lot, or toss and turn, you might want to consider a king-sized bed that will allow them to do so without disturbing the other person\u2019s sleep.\nQueen-sized mattress\nMeasuring 60\u201d x 80\u201d and fitting a queen-sized bed, a queen-sized mattress is a great option for couples who might not have large enough rooms to accommodate a king-sized bed. You can still fit two people comfortably, with the possibility of a small child or baby as well, though it would be a tighter fit than if you had a king.\nDouble/Full-sized mattress\nFitting what you\u2019d call either a double or a full-sized bed, these mattresses/beds are great for sleeping one or two people. You might buy one for your child\u2019s room, or for a guest room of the home. But for small houses with very small rooms, a double/full-sized beds can still do the job for two, though it might be trying if one or both people tend to move around a lot, or like to stretch out when they sleep. A double might also be OK for two kids sharing a bed.\nSingle XL/Twin XL or Single twin-sized mattress\nPerfect for young children getting their first bed, a single XL or twin XL bed is 39\u201d x 80\u201d, while a single twin bed is 39\u201d x 75\u201d in size. Don\u2019t expect to fit more than one child or adult in such a bed, without feeling like a pair of sardines, though, and risking someone falling out in the middle of the night!\nWhat to look for when choosing a mattress\nBefore selecting the perfect mattress, consider these important factors.\nThe type of mattress and how you sleep\nWhen it comes to the type of mattresses, consider how the person/people who will be sleeping in the bed tend to sleep. Do you like to hop into bed and feel extra cool as you sleep, or are you looking for toasty warmth? Do you sleep on your tummy or back, or constantly move around and want to be able to do so comfortably? If you suffer from neck or back pain, having the right firmness and type of mattress can be crucial to a good night\u2019s sleep.\nFor a bed that will accommodate more than one person, you\u2019ll need to find a happy medium. For example, if you both sleep on your backs or sides, but one person is a lot heavier than the other, you might want to opt for a slightly firmer mattress that will better contour to the heavier person, but still offer some flex for the lighter one.\nMore importantly, after you research the types of mattresses and firmness levels, get out there and try them all out. Lie down on a mattress, whether it\u2019s in a store or at a friend\u2019s house, and see how you feel. Make sure to stay for at least a few minutes so you can see not only how firm the mattress is as soon as you lie on it, but also how it contours to your body as you get comfortable. Move around, lie in different positions, and check your level of comfort, and pressure points.\nThe materials of the mattress\nWhile you will have a sheet overtop the mattress, you still want to consider the use of materials, and whether you have sensitive skin and/or allergies to any types of material. The safest option is to look for one that is hypoallergenic.\nYou can also look for things like antimicrobial, or mattresses that are made from organic materials.\nIf you sweat a lot at night, tend to just generally run hot, or have a home where the air conditioning doesn\u2019t quite get as cold upstairs in the bedrooms as it does downstairs during the hot summer months, look for a mattress that is made from breathable fibres, and that has moisture-wicking technology.\nAccessories for mattresses\nOnce you\u2019ve selected the right mattress, consider useful accessories, like a mattress protector/topper that can keep it protected in the event of accidental spills, or bedwetting from a young child. Mattress protectors can also help protect a mattress against things like bed bugs, and regulate the temperature.\nYou\u2019ll also, of course, need a nice set of sheets, including a fitted sheet to go over the mattress or mattress protector, and a good set of pillows. Don\u2019t skimp on the pillows, by the way: finding the right pillows is also essential to getting good rest.\nFinally, you might want to get a box spring as well to place under the mattress, if the bed-frame is low and you want the bed to be positioned much higher.\nTake the next step\nCheck out lots of mattresses, of all types, shapes, sizes, levels of firmness, and materials, along with the bedding to go with them, at Best Buy Online.", "tv": "Every year, televisions are upgraded with new features and new technology. If you\u2019d like to buy a new TV, here\u2019s a look at the features to consider when choosing new TV right now.\nTable of contents\nTV screen size\nChoosing what size of TV to buy is based on your personal size preference, your room size, and your mounting options. You\u2019ll want to keep in mind the width and weight of the TV as that can affect whether you can mount it on your wall or you need an entertainment stand. Televisions can be as small as about 30 inches and as large as 80 inches (or more!).\nA 55-inch TV can be a relatively lightweight 60lbs that you can safely mount on your wall or you may opt for a large, 100lb 75-inch TV that will need to be placed on a stand. You can decide what size you\u2019d like without leaving the house. All you need is a tape measure.\n1. Measuring the screen size of a TV\nTo get an accurate idea of how big a TV will be, you can measure the screen itself. Screen size is measured from one corner of the panel to the other without including the bezel or frame of the TV. To measure just pull your tape measure diagonally across the panel from the edge at the top of the screen to the edge at the bottom and jot down that number.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if the viewable display area of your new TV is slightly smaller or larger than the listed size. The size of the bezel or frame can affect viewable display size, and the brand may round the listed size up or down slightly to fit in a size category.\n2. How to measure your space for a new TV\nTake a tape measure and measure out the distance between your main seating area and the TV. You\u2019ll want to be comfortable while watching, so aim for a distance that\u2019s far enough away so you won\u2019t have to strain your neck to watch. You can decide on viewing distance in one of two ways. If you don\u2019t know what size of TV will work for the room, you can calculate your viewing distance by doubling the screen size. For example, if the measurement between your couch and your TV is 100 inches, divide that in half and you\u2019ll get 50 inches. That means you\u2019re in a good viewing range if you choose a TV that\u2019s 50 or 55 inches.\nIf you\u2019d like to upgrade the size of your TV and you\u2019re comfortable adjusting the room to fit your preferred screen size, you can use this quick chart to give you an idea of how far the TV should be from your couch.\nSize of TV\nComfortable viewing distance from couch\n40 inch TV 60 inches 43 inch TV 65 inches to 70 inches 49 inch TV 75 inches \u2013 80 inches 50 inch TV 75 inches \u2013 80 inches 55 inch TV 80 inches \u2013 90 inches 60 inch TV 90 inches to 100 inches 65 inch TV 105 inches to 115 inches 70 inch TV 115 inches to 120 inches 75 inch TV 120 inches to 130 inches 80 inch TV 130 inches to 140 inches 85 inch TV Minimum 140 inches from couch\n3. Is a bigger TV always better?\nIt\u2019s pretty amazing having a really big screen in your home. It makes watching movies and TV shows feel just like you\u2019re in the theatre. The only time where a bigger TV won\u2019t be better is if your room is too small for it that you are either super close to the screen or the television takes away from the overall aesthetic of the space. The best thing to do before committing to a very large TV is to check your viewing distance. If you are unsure you could bring your room measurements to a Best Buy location and ask one of the Blue Shirt professionals for advice. Additionally, you can call Best Buy\u2019s In home advisor program for a free consultation.\nTelevision resolution and screen types\nBefore you buy a new TV, you\u2019ll need to decide on TV resolution and TV backlight. To decide on the best resolution for you, it\u2019s helpful to know a few terms.\n1. Resolution\nResolution is the number of vertical pixels or dots that make up your TV\u2019s picture. Whether you have a 55-inch TV or a 30-inch TV, the more pixels your display has the better the overall image quality. You want your resolution to match the content you\u2019re watching, so if you normally watch a lot of 4K content, you\u2019ll want to choose a TV with 4K resolution.\nYou can read more about pixels and resolution in the 4K TV Buying Guide.\n2. Aspect ratio\nAspect ratio is the ratio of the height to width of the display. It\u2019s important because it indicates how the TV can display different resolutions without stretching or adding blank space around the picture.\n3. 1080P, 4K, or 8K resolution\nThere are a few different resolutions you can choose when buying a new TV: 1080p Full HD, 4K, and 8K.\n1080p TV has two million pixels (1920 x 1080)\n4K Ultra HD TV has eight million pixels (3840 x 2160)\n8K TV has approximately thirty-three million pixels (7,680 by 4,320)\n4K is currently the most popular option for TVs. The picture quality is outstanding, there is a wide variety of choices for brand and TV type with 4K resolution, and you\u2019ll find 4K content on all streaming services including Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and many more. 8K TVs are available, but online content hasn\u2019t quite caught up to that level of resolution. If you\u2019re looking for a TV you can enjoy for years to come, a 4K TV is a great choice.\nLED, QLED, or OLED\nThere are a lot of different types of TV, but the main three terms you\u2019ll hear the most right now are LED, QLED, and OLED. You can also take a look at this article on Full array TV.\n1. LED TVs\nLED TVs are a popular display choice. LED stands for light emitting diode, and TVs of this type use hundreds or thousands of LEDs are the light source for the display. You can find LED TVs in 1080p, 4K, and 8K, with Ultra HD LED TVs being the most popular right now.\nThe term LED describes the type of backlight the TV uses, so it\u2019s been an easy technology for manufacturers to enhance. There are currently a few popular choices in LED TVs including QLED and Mini-LED.\n2. QLED TVs\nQLED TVs use LEDs as the backlight, but a QLED TV has quantum dots layered over LED diodes. These dots are really tiny, and each one lights up as an individual colour when the backlight shines on them. Quantum dots enhance an LED TV, but your picture quality will be even better if you choose a QLED TV with Mini-LED.\nYou can read more about QLED TVs in this post about QLED TVs explained.\n3. Mini-LED TVs\nMini-LED is a new backlight technology. Mini-LEDs are a type of LED, but they much smaller so you can pack thousands and thousands of Mini-LEDs into the same space you could only fit hundreds of LEDs. The more lights your TV has, the better control it will have for colour, contrast, and detail.\nMini-LEDs provide the backlight for QLED TVs, so if you choose a Mini-LED you\u2019ll have a TV with a layer of quantum dots to enhance the colour even further. LG also has their own take on QLED with Mini-LED called Quantum Dot NanoCell.\nThe difference between a 4K LED TV and a QLED TV is striking. The picture will appear brighter and sharper and tiny detail will be very noticeable. Colours will be very vivid, and when the screen goes black, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a deep, dark black and not grey-ish. Mini-LED TVs create such a spectacular display that they run second only to OLED in terms of picture quality.\nYou can find out more about Mini-LED TVs and MicroLED TVs by reading Why you should consider a Mini-LED TV and The bright future of MicroLED.\n4. OLED TVs\nOLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. An OLED TV does not have a backlight like an LED. It uses thousands of diodes that are self-illuminating, and each diode can turn off and on individually. OLED TVs can display millions of colour variations and they are the only TV that can display \u2018true black\u2019 because the diodes can turn completely off or on. If you stand in front of a 4K OLED TV you\u2019ll be blown away by the colour of every image, how dark the blacks are in a night scene with stars, and how everything looks vivid and almost better than real life.\nYou can learn more about how OLED works by reading OLED vs QLED \u2013 What should your next TV be?\nFeatures to look for when buying a new TV\nNow that you have an idea of what you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the options on different TVs.\n1. Refresh rate\nRefresh rate refers to how often your screen refreshes. If you have a 60Hz refresh rate, it will refresh 60 times every second. If you have a 120Hz refresh rate, your TV will refresh 120 times per second. If you have a gamer in the house or you watch fast-paced sports, you\u2019ll love how smooth action is when you have a TV with 120Hz. If you\u2019re just watching movies or TV, the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz won\u2019t be that noticeable to you. Many of the latest TVs offer 120Hz refresh rate as a standard feature.\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, you may want to take a look at the best gaming TVs of 2021.\n2. HDMI and USB ports\nWhen you buy a TV you\u2019ll want to take a look at the different ports it has. If you have a lot of external devices like cable boxes, Blu-ray players, or gaming consoles, you\u2019ll want to make sure your new TV has enough spots to plug in all of your devices. Most new TVs have three HDMI ports, one HDMI ARC port for a soundbar or home receiver, and one or two USB ports. HDMI has also evolved to HDMI 2.1, and this upgrade supports higher resolution video and 4K refresh rates at 120Hz. If you have a gamer in the house, you\u2019ll want to choose a new TV with HDMI 2.1.\n3. HDR\nNew TVs have HDR (High Dynamic Range) as an option. Having HDR on your TV means your TV can produce better peak brightness, deeper black levels, and auto-adjust for improved contrast overall. The result is picture quality that\u2019s more realistic and authentic than a TV without HDR. Many of the latest TVs now offer HDR10 as the standard format.\n4. Smart TVs\nMost of the latest TVs are also smart TVs. They connect to your Wi-Fi and have pre-loaded apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ pre-installed. Some smart TVs have voice control too, so you can just say \u201cOK Google, open up YouTube.\u201d\nYou can learn more about the different types of smart TVs by reading Learning about smart TV operating systems.\n5. Sound quality\nNew TVs have built-in speakers and use technology to boost and define output for movies, TV shows, and music. While the sound quality of a new TV is always going to be great, if you\u2019d like to boost it so you can enhance dialogue or put more emphasis on sound effects, you can choose a sound bar for an instant sound upgrade. You can find sound bars at various price points, some have additional speakers like subwoofers, and many offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so you can stream your playlists too.\nSpecific types of TVs you can choose\nOne of the easiest ways to choose a new TV is to find one based on your specific interest. There are gaming TVs and zTVs for the tech enthusiast. If you\u2019d like to stick to a low budget, you can also choose TVs under $500.\n1. TVs for gamers\nGaming TVS are a favourite among gamers for quite a few reasons. Gaming TVs have features built in to make console gaming a seamless experience. You can plug your console in and your TV will automatically detect it and choose the best settings for your specific game.\nGaming TVs have low input lag so your controllers match the action on screen. They also have fast refresh rate, with some models offering 120Hz for blistering fast gameplay. You can choose a gaming TV with a gamer hub to give you access to all of your console and PC games in one spot. Take a look at all of the features on gaming TVs by checking out the gaming TV buying guide.\n2. TVs for the techie\nIf you\u2019re someone who likes to upgrade their TV as soon as there is exciting new technology available, you\u2019ll love the latest TV releases. The newest TVs have AI processors that adapt to your favourite content, enhancing picture quality on the fly. They can also upscale older video. If you choose a new 4K TV, your must-watch 1080p movies can be upscaled to as close as 2K or 4K as possible.\nYou\u2019ll find new TV releases from big brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG. Choose from the latest OLED TVs with improved colour volume for the brightest, boldest picture possible. There are newly released QLED TVs, and some also use an ultra-bright Mini-LED backlight paired with a quantum dot overlay for stunning true to life colour and imagery.\n3. TVs at low prices\nIf you\u2019re on a budget you can find a TV you\u2019ll love for less than $500. There are low priced gaming TVs and smart TVs, and you can choose a TV on sale in sizes ranging from 32 inches up to 69 inches. You\u2019ll want to check back every day for new TVs on sale, and you can also find open box or refurbished TVS for a great price.\nHow much should I expect to pay for my new TV?\nHow much you pay for your new TV will depend on the screen size, resolution, and type of TV you choose. The least expensive TVs right now are 1080p Full HD resolution, and you\u2019ll find these TVs are smaller, have a simpler backlight like edge lighting or simple LED, and have limited port options for connecting cable boxes or gaming consoles.\nIn terms of a 4K TV, you\u2019ll pay less for a 4K LED with limited connection options than you would for a 4K QLED with Mini-LED backlight and features like multiple HDMI 2.1 ports. The most expensive type of TV right now is OLED, with 8K OLED more expensive than a 4K OLED.\nYou\u2019ll also pay more for a larger screen size, so if you\u2019re debating a 65-inch TV vs a 75-inch TV, you\u2019ll pay more for the larger panel.\nTake the next step\nAre you ready to bring home your new TV? Buy a new TV now by shopping online or in-store at Best Buy.", "laptop": "Laptops have been outselling desktop PCs for over a decade, with good reason. On the obvious side, they\u2019re portable. However, that doesn\u2019t mean choosing a laptop requires having to compromise on capability; configured correctly, a laptop can do anything you need a PC to do and sometimes more. With new options like convertible laptops and Chromebooks, the number of choices available to laptop shoppers is better than ever.\nLaptop Buying Guide Quick Reference Handout\nWhen we talk about laptops, we\u2019re using an umbrella term that covers a series of portable PCs, each suited for a different purpose. While the general clamshell form factor is the common thread, each can be very different when it comes to capabilities, intended use and price.\nPlatform: Windows, MacBook or Chromebook?\nOne of the biggest questions when it comes to laptops is should you purchase an Apple computer, a Windows computer, or a Chromebook? It usually makes sense to go with the platform you are most comfortable with, that you have compatible software for, or that your school or employer uses. Here are the main differentiators of these three types of laptops:\nApple laptops include all versions of Macbook (E.g., Macbook Air, MarbookPro) and are all produced by Apple. They come with the latest Apple operating system, an assortment of Apple software, and select software from other vendors. Most productivity and especially creative software bundles offer a version that will run on Apple computers. Prior to 2020 their main processor chip was provided by Intel. However, over the past few years Apple has begun to transition their MacBooks to its own chips (M1 and M2 are available in some Apple laptops). Generally speaking, Mac laptops have tended to be more popular with people who need to run creative software (photo or video editing for example). Windows laptops differ from Macbooks in many ways. First, they all include the latest version of Microsoft Windows operating system (currently Windows 11). The difference in operating system means there are also some differences in the software and accessories used on Windows machines compared to Apple machines. A second important difference is that you\u2019ll find Windows machines produced by a variety of manufacturers including HP, Asus, Acer, MSI, Dell, Gigabyte, and many others. The main processor chip will also vary a lot more but are usually made by Intel or AMD. Windows computers also tend to be more popular in business and enterprise environments and for gaming. Chromebooks are a more recent addition to the laptop world\u2014although they have now been around for a decade. Chromebooks operate using Google\u2019s Chrome operating system or Chrome OS, which was designed to leverage cloud-based applications like G-Suite. Chromebooks require less powerful processors than other laptops, they require less RAM (4GB is average), and for local storage will often use a small, speedy SSD\u2014typically starting at around 32GB. High end Chromebooks can go toe-to-toe with MacBooks and Windows laptops for performance and versatility. Chromebooks are also able to run Android apps.They make an excellent, affordable option that is especially popular among students.\nTypes of laptops\nThere are three main types of laptops: every day laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and gaming laptops.\nMost laptops including Macbooks, many Windows laptops, and Chomebooks are everyday laptops intended to be a default choice for someone who needs a portable machine that can do just about anything. They\u2019re also priced across a wide range to suit a wide variety of needs. Most people choose a display in the 13-inch to 15-inch range and specs good enough to take on basic tasks, including word processing, web browsing, streaming video, or light gaming. Many of these can be upgraded with additional memory to extend their functionality and lifespan. Select the right combination of price and capability for your needs for home, for school, or for business applications. 2-in-1 laptops enable the screen to fold right back over the device creating two devices at the same time: a laptop, and a tablet. These are mostly Windows computers, though there are some Chromebook 2-in-1 laptops as well. Many of these function in more than just two orientations. For example, tent position is great for watching video or displaying info without a keyboard in the way. Thanks to ingenious hinges that twist, slide, or flip, the display can be positioned flat against the bottom of the case, transforming the device into a tablet form factor, perfect for running apps designed for tablets or for use with a stylus. Some 2-in-1s go even further, actually allowing the display to physically separate from the base as a standalone tablet. With this versatility, it\u2019s no wonder 2-in-1 laptops are so popular. Gaming laptops are Windows machines that pull off a very difficult trick, by stuffing the components needed to run video games\u2014one of the most demanding tasks for a PC\u2014inside a portable case. Display sizes can range from 13-inches to 17-inches. Some of these may look little chunky compared to other models due to all of the components and necessary cooling technology needed for high end gaming performance. These also usually have a dedicated graphics card inside, as well as a beefy CPU and other high end components, which accounts for the usually slightly higher price point on these machines.Recent advances in mobile processors and graphics cards have led to a generation of gaming laptops that embrace being thin, looking as sleek as ultraportables from several years ago. Power demand is also high for gaming laptops and although they have large batteries, they can\u2019t compare to other laptop types for battery life. Anywhere from 3 to 5 hours used to be typical, but some gaming laptops can now last all-day, at least for non-gaming use. While these mobile PCs are aimed squarely at gamers, because of their big, high resolution displays and powerful CPUs, multitude of ports, and high quality keyboards, gaming laptops are often used by professionals as well\u2014especially those who need to run demanding software like Photoshop.\n(click here to see all laptops on sale)\nLaptop components\nThere are many components that go into every laptop, but there are four that have the biggest impact on a laptop\u2019s performance and capabilities and cost: The CPU, RAM, storage space, and the display. Most laptops rely on their CPU\u2019s integrated graphics, but when choosing a gaming laptop the graphics card becomes the critical component. When searching for a laptop online at Best Buy, you will find most of the main components listed right at the top of a product page next to the product name.\nCPU: cores and clock speed: Think of the CPU as the brains of the operation. The more demanding the tasks a laptop needs to perform, the more brain power it needs. When we talk about CPUs, several terms are worth knowing. Clock speed (measured in GHz) tells you how many cycles per second a CPU can perform. All other things being equal, a CPU at a higher clock speed will be faster than a lower one. Cores are processing units that can perform instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the better because this means it can perform multiple instructions simultaneously.\nThere are also families of CPUs that provide varying degrees of power, and within those families, different generations. Intel is currently releasing 12th generation Core mobile processors, with features like integrated Wi-Fi 6, onboard 4K video support, and improved overall performance. Laptops that meet Intel\u2019s Evo standard (read more about it here) combine 11th Gen or the newest 12th Gen Core CPUs, 4K HDR video, and all-day battery life. AMD is rolling out its newest Ryzen series of mobile processors with more processor cores, 4K support, and the latest Wi-Fi support.\nAnd then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips, with a huge boost in performance, integrated graphics capabilities, and laptops with battery life up to 20 hours. You can read more details about the newest M2 here. The latest processors from each of these companies also incorporate various degrees of AI integration.\nNeedless to say, all of this can be more than a little confusing. What should you be looking for in a laptop CPU?\nIf it\u2019s a MacBook, you\u2019ll be choosing first between an Intel chip and an M1 or M2. If you go with M2, you get up to 10 GPU cores (more GPU cores improves the graphics capabilities for content creators).\nA general purpose laptop will be equipped with a CPU from a lower to mid-range processor family, typically with four cores at a modest clock rate. A quad-core, Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 with 6 cores is a common configuration. Move to a more powerful laptop suited to professional use and the CPU will be much beefier too. You might find a 6-core Intel Core i5 processor, or an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7. Gaming laptops require maximum performance, so you\u2019ll start to find the more powerful processors in this class. They will usually have an Intel Core i7, or Core i9 with upwards of 14 cores.\nRAM: what is it and how much do you need?\nRAM (or Random Access Memory) is where the laptop stores information it\u2019s currently using. The general rule of thumb is that there is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM you have on tap, the more applications you can have open and the snappier your performance will be. That being said, RAM costs money, so you need to find a balance.\nWith Windows 11, the minimum supported RAM is 4GB, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a laptop running either Windows or macOS that has less than 8GB installed. Otherwise, it may run now, but a few OS upgrades in or too many apps open at once, and it\u2019s likely to start slowing down considerably. So usually a minimum of 8GB of RAM will be installed, and often 16GB. A power user or a gaming laptop would benefit from having at least 16GB of RAM on tap. If you don\u2019t need the extra RAM today, chances are you will before long.\nWith Chromebooks. 4GB of RAM is the current standard, but 8GB will let you have many tabs open without a performance hit, and a few premium Chromebooks offer a 16GB option. For most users 8GB will provide a great experience for the lifetime of the Chromebook, but for a budget-friendly option 4GB should be fine.\nDon\u2019t forget, many laptops ship with the RAM soldered to the motherboard, which means you don\u2019t have the option of upgrading later on. So plan for what you might need in a few years.\nStorage: SSD vs HDD and capacity\nHDD or Hard Disk Drive is the technology that\u2019s been used for onboard storage for decades. It\u2019s a spinning platter with a magnetic head, it works well and it\u2019s inexpensive.\nSSD (Solid State Storage) has become the preferred choice in recent years, thanks to its inclusion in popular 2-in-1 computers, Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBook Air. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs\u2014especially at large capacities\u2014but they have multiple advantages including lower power consumption, no moving parts, silent operation and especially speed. A laptop that takes 60 seconds to boot up with an HDD might take only 10 seconds if equipped with an SSD. Most Windows laptops these days are offering an SSD as a standard option, while all MacBooks and Chromebooks only offer solid state drives. Some laptops offer hybrid drives that combine a small capacity SSD with a traditional HDD. The operating system is stored on SSD for faster operation, while the HDD offers plenty of cheap storage.\nLike RAM, experienced PC owners will tell you that there is no such thing as too much storage.However, cost is once again a factor here, especially if you are looking at a high capacity SSD. When it comes to capacity, most general purpose laptops offer 500GB of storage, while professional and gaming laptops often hit 1TB. Some gaming laptops are actually equipped with dual drive bays, so you have the option of adding additional storage at a later time.\nLaptops (other than Chromebooks) equipped with an SSD typically start at 256GB and go up to 1TB.\nThe display\nNever take the display for granted. This is the component you\u2019ll be interacting with the most and it can make or break your laptop experience. It also dictates the overall size of the laptop and can have a very big impact on price. Display sizes on most laptops range from 13 inches to 17 inches.\nPay attention to resolution. A large, 17-inch display with low resolution will look pixelated\u2014it\u2019s like watching standard definition video, up close, on a 60-inch Ultra HD TV. A small display with low resolution will look crisper, but it won\u2019t be able to show as much information.\nWhen it comes to cost, the larger the display the larger the price tag, and as you go up in resolution the cost also increases. The trick is to find the combination of display size and resolution that meets your needs. For general purpose web browsing, a 13-inch display at Full HD (1080p) resolution should suit most people, but business users and gamers will want 15-inches or more with at least Full HD resolution, and possibly 4K.\nAspect ratio is important as well (that\u2019s the ratio of width to height). Gamers and those who stream a lot of video often prefer laptops with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which corresponds perfectly to HD 1920 x 1080 video. Laptops with a 16:10 aspect ratio have \u201ctaller\u201d displays that show a few extra lines on a document. If you work primarily with documents and spreadsheets, a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio maximizes the vertical display space for less scrolling up and down.\nOther display variables such as contrast ratio, HDR support, colour accuracy, brightness and reflectivity primarily come into play with professional and gaming laptops. With a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to display refresh rates, and support for technology like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.\nIf you use Windows\u2019 touch gestures, you\u2019ll also want a touchscreen-enabled display\u2014an option that\u2019s not available on the Mac platform. Many Chromebooks also offer touchscreen support, especially 2-in-1 models.\nSome laptops now offer second screen options, including the Touch Bar on Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro, and the ScreenPad on some ASUS ZenBook models.\nOther components/features worth considering\nWireless connectivity ( Wi-Fi 6 is the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard\nis the latest and fastest standard\u2014while Bluetooth 5 is the current short range wireless standard Ethernet may be a requirement for professional users\nPorts for USB accessories, memory cards and video output (watch for the inclusion of both USB Type-A ports for legacy accessories and the new USB-C for high speed and video/power support).\nKeyboard and trackpad (quality varies as do extra features like backlighting, programmability, and a standalone numeric keypad)\nA webcam and microphone(s) have proven invaluable to those who find themselves working or learning from home.\nBuilt-in speakers, which range from basic to quad-speakers with Dolby-certified audio\nBattery life\nWeight\nFinal consideration: How upgradable is a laptop\nDesktop PCs can be upgrade in many ways: from the case to the power supply, video card, CPU, and beyond. Laptops are largely sealed units and at most are limited to adding more RAM or storage, or replacing the battery. When considering an Ultrabook, MacBook or Convertible laptop, it\u2019s important to know that many of these super-slim notebook PCs achieve some of their space savings through use of soldered RAM and SSDs, and batteries that are specially designed to fill any available space within the body. For most people, the best advice is to plan ahead: choose the model with the maximum amount of RAM and the largest capacity SSD you can afford, because in two years or so as applications take up more space and require more memory for smooth functioning, you may not have the option of upgrading these components.\nTake the next step\nNow that you have a better understanding about what all the buzzwords and tech specs mean, check out Best Buy\u2019s huge selection of laptops.

It covers many various musical duties: rhythm, harmony, melody and you can even accompany yourself while you sing. Combined with the fact that it\u2019s highly portable, what you get is the ultimate entertainment tool. If you are interested in checking out this world of possibilities, you might be overwhelmed by the wealth of choices and specifications related to the guitar. We created this guide to help you learn about guitars so you can make the best purchasing decision for you and your family.\nTable of Contents:\nTypes of guitars\nThe image above shows three of the different types of guitars that will be covered in this section: an electric, a 12 string acoustic, and a six string acoustic. There are several families of guitars, each having subdivisions of their own. It\u2019s important to grasp the base concepts when first starting out, to develop familiarity and comprehend the effect on the sound. Your musical preferences will also definitely influence your choice of guitar type.\n1. Acoustic guitars\nThe six string acoustic guitar is the most common guitar for first-time buyers. Countless legendary songs have been composed on one of these and it still continues to inspire many new artists for their creations. This steel-stringed instrument is a perfect place to start your musical journey because of the immense catalog of musical material available to it, from pop repertoire to difficult technical exercises that will push you to become a better guitarist and musician.\nAn acoustic guitar is a self-amplified instrument that comes in a variety of sizes. The most common shape is the Dreadnought, named after the Martin guitar of the same name. There are other proportions available such as the OM, Jumbo, and Parlour. While these provide certain different tonal characteristics, if you are looking at a first guitar, the Dreadnought is likely the best all-around choice. Some manufacturers offer smaller scaled guitars that include \u00bd and \u00be guitars: these are often preferred by younger players. Despite a smaller size, many of these have a rich tone and are used by professionals (e.g., Ed Sheeran uses a smaller guitar). Jasmine has a wide variety of guitars that are affordable and well-made and are great for beginners.\n2. Acoustic-Electric Guitars\nIf you plan on performing with an acoustic guitar, the easiest way is to get one that you can plug in to an amplifier: these are often called acoustic-electric guitars. Many models are shipped with an integrated pickup system. Manufacturers actually offer two versions of their models, one with electronics and one without, so make sure you know which kind you want.\nEpiphone has many different guitars that are based on legendary Gibson models and that include integrated pickups. Amongst these is the very popular Hummingbird which was used famously by The Rolling Stones, Sheryl Crowe, and Chris Cornell.\n3. Nylon/Classical guitars\nThese guitars follow the same basic concept as acoustic guitars: a self-amplified instrument. The major differences lie in the neck shape and, especially, the fact that they have nylon strings instead of steel ones. This plays a major role in the tone of the guitar and it produces a very warm and soothing timbre. You\u2019ll most likely encounter these guitars in classical and world music, but they sometimes make an appearance in pop, rock and even metal.\nA distinction is often made between a classical and a nylon-string product. This is because the classical variant usually follows traditional building principals while the nylon-string might make use of more modern concepts.\nNylon stringed instruments have often been recommended for beginners because they offer a painless playing experience, something that can be bothersome on the steel-stringed models. However, the neck is wider, so younger players will definitely benefit from using a smaller scale design.\n4. Electric guitars\nThe electric guitar has immensely shaped the way music is written and produced in the last seven decades. Its immense tonal variances have enabled creative musicians to create textures that are sometimes so different from one another, that it is hard to believe that they come from the same instrument. This extremely versatile tool is what you get in an electric guitar.\n5. Basses\nFor those that love the low end of the sound spectrum and insuring that the music has a stable, reliable accompaniment, the bass is the perfect tool. Basses traditionally have four strings, but some models extend the lower range with a fifth string. There\u2019s nothing like hitting those sub-bass tones in any style of music. If you are a complete beginner, you might benefit from making things as simple as possible and limiting the number of strings to the traditional four.\nHow to choose the right guitar\nThings to consider when selecting your first instrument\nOnce you\u2019ve picked a type of guitar, it\u2019s then just a matter of finding the ideal model for you. Big guitar manufacturers such as Yamaha, Epiphone, and Gibson offer all types and represent excellent value for your money. For example, Yamaha\u2019s C, FS and FG series are extremely popular nylon and acoustic lines that you will find in households and classrooms throughout the world. Their solid construction also holds up very well to our particular Canadian climate for years of playing enjoyment.\nIf you are going the electric guitar or bass route, Kramer has traditional S-type guitars that have great value for the money. Epiphone by Gibson offer various bundles of their most popular models.\nThe great thing about electric instruments is that they are easily upgradable and you can always find a use for them. Here are a couple of things to consider about electric guitars:\nKey consideration #1: pickups One of the biggest factors to consider is if you want a single coil guitar (such as a Stratocaster) or a humbucker guitar (like a Les Paul). These terms refer to the number of coils the pickups on the guitar possess. Humbuckers are more powerful and full sounding than their single coil counterparts and go well with more gain. This is great if you are interested in distorted sounds, such as rock and even heavier music. Single coils, on the other hand, are great for pop, country, and blues, thanks to their brighter, jangly tone. Often watching the choices made by your favourite artists can help you decide which type is right for your musical tastes. If you are unsure, there are guitars that incorporate both types of pickups in the same guitar. The fat strat (and all its offshoots) is a perfect example of this.\nKey consideration #2: bridge type Some electric guitars have a floating tremolo which helps you add a lot of different inflections to your notes and riffs (pull up or down on the tremolo bar to bend the notes higher or lower). The downside is that the bridge tension has to be positioned to an exact setting, so you can\u2019t easily change tunings without seriously compromising the stability of the tuning: it may have trouble staying in tune. Additionally, if you go to a lower tuning, therefore lowering the tension on the strings, the bridge will sag and greatly affect your playing experience. A fixed bridge avoids this problem, but takes out the possibility to play with the pitch using the tremolo.\nHow to choose your second guitar\nIf you are already comfortable with the basics or you are shopping for a second guitar, it\u2019s time to look at what you are missing. For example, if you have a fixed bridge on your electric guitar, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to check out a floating tremolo unit. There will be many new things to learn and to experiment with.\nAdditionally, if you have a single coil guitar, you might want to explore the soundscapes available with humbuckers, or vice versa. New doors will open to you and it\u2019s an interesting experiment to see how much your impression of the instrument will change. If you gradually build up your options, you will easily find motivation to practise and try novel techniques. This will lead to a more complete understanding of the guitar, making you a better player and musician.\nTwo great instruments exist that really complement each other; the Stratocaster and Les Paul. These instruments have been featured in all styles and you will never run out of music to play with them. Other essential models include the Telecaster, SG and more modern concepts by Jackson, Ibanez and ESP made for technical playing.\nIf you are more of an acoustic player, you can definitely complement your steel string acoustic with the mellow tones of a nylon-stringed model and vice versa. Also, there are many different acoustic shapes to look into. OM shapes provide an excellent singing tone that really lends itself to singer-songwriter situations and intricate fingerstyle. Jumbos provide a huge sound, perfect for riveting strumming. Parlour guitars produce a soft intimate sound: silky chords and singing melodies. Lastly, the twelve string guitar adds a different dimension and fullness to playing thanks to doubling up each string, with some of them tuned an octave higher.\nHigh end guitars: factors that can affect the price\nWhen it comes to the high end of guitars, you are usually paying for the expertise of the builder, the quality of components and location of the factory. American and Japanese-made instruments fetch a topmost price because they are undertaken by highly qualified personnel working with choice woods, the best components, and very involved designs.\nInstruments that feature things like an arch top, set necks and rare woods also inflate the price tag. Sometimes these features are more for comfort or looks than actual sound improvement. Take the time to understand what you are paying for and if you need it.\nThat being said, high quality instruments present several advantages. First of all, they are very steady. A lot of research has gone into treating the wood so that it stays stable, staying in tune and presenting a consistent tone over years, no matter the environmental conditions. Secondly, they usually have the best possible resale value, so if ever you feel like you need a change, you can trade or sell it for another high-end model without too much of a hassle.\nLast but not least, these types of instruments have an intangible factor to them. If you ever played such a guitar, you\u2019ll know that mojo is very important in music creation. There is something about an instrument that screams back when you yell at it, that cries when you sing to it and that evokes emotions when you paint with it. While all of this might seem ethereal, it\u2019s an unexplainable feeling that you get when you use something that was crafted seemingly for you. Eventually, all players deserve this type of relationship.\nGuitar accessories every one should have\nHere are some the standard accessories most guitarists own (in no particular order):\n1. A good case will help you carry your guitar safely from one location to another. If you don\u2019t plan on doing long distance travelling, a soft case is more than enough. These are light and usually feature shoulder straps for hands-free movement. Otherwise, a hard case is a good investment to protect your precious investment, especially if it\u2019s a more expensive item.\n2. A good tuner is also essential. Even though it\u2019s important to develop your ear and learn to tune to a simple reference tone, it\u2019s always good to double check your pitch with a dedicated tool. This will not only help with your hearing acuity, it will provide a pleasant, harmonious playing experience for you and whoever is close-by.\n3. Extra strings on hand. A few packs can help you keep the music alive if you happen to break one. Changing strings isn\u2019t hard at all and many excellent resources are available online.\n4 Other essentials include: straps for comfort either sitting down or standing up, a guitar stand to have quick and safe access to your instrument and a variety of picks (they are very easy to lose). Also, almost every guitarist owns a selection of capos: these allow you to press down all strings higher up the neck, altering the tuning of the whole instrument. For example, if a song is in C, you can put the capo on the third fret and play it in A for a different feel and tone, though it\u2019s in the same key.\nIf you go with an acoustic instrument, some kind of humidifying product will keep your guitar in great playing condition year-round. With the dry, heated air wreaking havoc on necks, soundboards, and bodies during the winter months, it\u2019s better to anticipate and save you a lot of trouble and heartache if something goes wrong. These can help maintaining the integrity of your electric instruments also.\nHopefully, this guide has cleared up some of the peculiarities of the guitar world. There\u2019s nothing like trying out many models for yourself and analyzing how you work with a particular instrument. Make sure you check out all the different guitars available. Best Buy has many of them from some of the most renown makers.\nTake the next step\nTake a look at all the guitars and accessories available on Best Buy\u2019s website."}
